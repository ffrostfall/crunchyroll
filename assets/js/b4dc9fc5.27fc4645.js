You can define a rig by calling crunchyroll.createrig, which is a representation of Roblox Motor6Ds. You can then pass this rig into crunchyroll.solveanimation, which also takes animation tracks. These are tables which are similar to Roblox\'s AnimationTracks. Similar to AnimationTracks, you need an animation \\"asset\\". You can load a Roblox animation by calling crunchyroll.loadkeyframesequence. Crunchyroll will then give you the coordinate frames of the \\"limbs\\" (think Torso, Head, \\"Left Leg\\", UpperTorso etc.), and that\'s it!","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"rigs":{"id":"rigs","title":"Rigs","description":"Rigs in crunchyroll are really just Motor6D instances in dictionary form.
